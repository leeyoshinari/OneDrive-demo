## Technology
- Framework: FastApi
- Database: SQLite3 or MySQL
- Front-end: html + js + css

## Deploy
1.Clone `git clone https://github.com/leeyoshinari/OneDrive.git` ；

2.`cd OneDrive`, and modify `config.conf`；

3.Install third-party packages
```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4.Initialize the database and execute the following commands in sequence
```shell script
aerich init -t settings.TORTOISE_ORM
aerich init-db
```

5.Install download tool [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases), running `aria2c -v` to verify whether the installation is successful.

6.Startup
```shell script
sh startup.sh
```

7.Create user<br>
In order to avoid malicious creation of users by others, the page does not open the entrance to create users. So, you can create a user in the API interface documentation, entering the `swagger-ui` page and finding the `createUser` interface.
```shell script
http://IP:Port/配置文件中的prefix/swagger-ui
```

8.Configure and start `nginx`, the location configuration is as follows:<br>
(1)Front-end configuration: The front-end file is in `web`, `/OneDrive` can be modified to any name you like.
```shell script
location /OneDrive {
    alias /home/OneDrive/web/;
    index  index.html;
}
```
(2)Backend request: `proxy_pass` is the IP and port in `config.conf`, `/mycloud` must be the same as `prefix` in `config.conf`.
```shell script
location /mycloud {
     proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:15200;
     proxy_set_header Host $proxy_host;
     proxy_set_header lang $http_lang;
     proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
     proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	 proxy_set_header Connection $proxy_connection;
     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```
(3) In the `http` module, a mapping need to be add.
```shell
map $http_upgrade $proxy_connection {
    default upgrade;
    "" close;
}
```
（4）Swagger page
```shell
location /api/openapi {
    proxy_pass  http://127.0.0.1:15200;
}
```

Usually nginx will limit the size of the request body, and you need to add `client_max_body_size 4096M;` to `nginx.conf`. There are other configurations, you can search for information and modify them online by yourself.

If you don’t know nginx, please go to [nginx official website](http://nginx.org/en/download.html) to download nginx and install it. After the installation is completed, replace the installed `nginx.conf` with the `nginx.conf` in this project, and then restart nginx.

9.Page, the url is `http://IP:Port/OneDrive` (the IP and port are the IP and port set in Nginx. `OneDrive` is the name of the front-end configuration in step 7)

10.If you want to import existing files on the current server into the system, you can access the background api interface page and find the `file/import` interface. The request parameters are the absolute path of the folder to be imported and the Id of the target catalog.

11.If you need to configure multiple languages, [Please click me](https://github.com/leeyoshinari/OneDrive/blob/main/web/detail.md).

## Others
1.Supports multiple platforms such as `Linux`, `Windows`, `MacOS`, etc. It is recommended to deploy on `Linux`.

2.Cluster deployment and distributed storage are not supported. If you need cluster deployment and distributed storage, [Please click me](https://github.com/leeyoshinari/mycloud).

3.The path of the background image of the login page is `web/img/pictures/undefined/background.jpg`. If you need to modify the login background image, you can directly replace this image. Note: the image name must be `background.jpg`.

4.The background image of the desktop is the same as the background image of the login page by default. If you need to modify it, you can upload it in `Setting->Personalized->Set background image`. After the upload is successful, clear the cache and refresh the page. Note: The image format must be `jpg`.

5.Playing videos online uses streaming playback, which requires that the metadata of the video must be at the front of the video file. So, you need to manually move the metadata of the video to the front of the video file. Using the [ffmpeg](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) to move the metadata of the video. The command: `ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -map_metadata 0 -c:v copy -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output_video.mp4`.

6.Whether you are using a PC browser or a mobile browser, setting the browser to display in full screen will provide a better user experience.
